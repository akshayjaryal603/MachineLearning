# Boston-House-Prediction

Linear regression is easy when done with libraries like sklearn and tensorflow but, when it comes to implement the whole algorithm from scratch, the things start to become tricky. In this jupyter notebook, I have tried to implement the gradient descent algorithm from scratch without the support of the above mentioned libraries. 

## Upcoming

- I am trying to improve the model by doing some feature scaling. Would update the repo as soon as it's done.
